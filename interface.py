This script provides a convenient interface to tmQM-RDF.

The class TmQMRDF allows to quickly extract the subgraph corresponding to any TMC, ligand, metal centre, or element reported in the dataset.

This script can be run directly to initialise the interface with the following settings:
        path_to_chem_info = ".",
        request_tmc_atoms = True,
        request_tmc_atomic_bonds = True,
        request_tmc_ligands = True,
        request_tmc_ligand_bonds = True,
        auto_expose_tmc_ligands = False.
See the docstring for TmQMRDF for the documentation.

    1. Accessing tmQM-RDF subgraphs
    ---
    This class is a dictionary-like object that internally stores selected subgraphs of tmQM-RDF.
    Namely, a subgraph can be accessed via the key (<category>, <code>), where:
        - category can be either "TMC", "ligand", "centre" or "element"
        - code is the corresponding code of the desired object (either the CSD code, the tmQMg-L ligand id, or the chemical symbol for both centres and elements)
    Initially, not all subgraphs are available. The desired subgraphs have to be "exposed" using the self.expose method. For quick access
    to single TMCs, ligand species or elements, the methods self.tmc, self.ligand or self.element can also be used.

    Each subgraph (the value returned by self[<category>, <code>]) exposes its rdf triples via the .rdf attribute, which is
    an rdflib.Graph object.
    
        1.1 Merging subgraphs
        See rdflib.Graph for more details on how to merge subgraphs.
        The method self.as_knowledge_graph() can be used to merge all the exposed subgraphs into a single graph.

    2. Subgraph attributes
    ---
    Additional category-specific attributes may be available. Specifically, TMCs expose the following attributes:
        - atoms: a list of pairs (atom_name, atom_element), where
            - atom_name is the name of the object representing the atom, intended
                as the last element on the URI path (e.g. if the URI is resource://integreat/p5/atomic/atom/XXYYZZ_El1,
                the name is XXYYZZ_El1)
            - atom_element is the chemical symbol of the element of the atom, again, extracted as the last element
                of the URI path of the element object
        - atomic_bonds: a list of pairs (atom1_name, atom2_name), where atom[n]_name is the name of the atom at the
            n-th end of the bond (n = 1,2). The atoms are ordered according to the IDs assigned in the
            tmQMg dataset, with id(atom1) < id(atom2).
        - ligands: a dictionary of the form {ligand_name: {'class': ligand_id, 'components': [...]}, ...}
            where:
                - ligand_name is the name of the ligand object (intended as the last element
                    on the URI path)
                - ligand_id is the id of the reference ligand
                - components is a list of the names of the atoms that compose this instance of the ligand
        - metal_centre: a dictionary of the form {'class': centre_element, 'components': [centre_atom]}
            where:
                - centre_element is the chemical element of the metal centre
                - centre_atom is the name of the atom representing the centre at the atomic level
        - ligand_bonds: a dictionary of the form {ligand_id: bonds, }, where ligand_id is the id of the ligand the
                bond refers to, and bonds is a list of lists (in the tmQMg-L sense) of the binding atoms.
    
    3. Import settings

    The actual import behaviour behaviour of the class is governed by the method self.set_import_setting.
